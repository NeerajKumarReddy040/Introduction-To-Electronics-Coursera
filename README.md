Practice quiz 4-1-1
Answers:

Diodes are made by connecting a p-doped material to an n-doped material, creating a depletion region that causes a barrier to the flow of electricity when the diode is reverse biased.
In the forward bias region, the diode current i_D is positive.
In the non-conducting (or OFF) state of an ideal diode, the diode voltage, V_D is negative.

Practice Quiz 4-1-2
Answers:

Semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors, and operational amplifiers are non-linear devices
Doping a semiconductor material with impurities to add extra holes or electrons improves the conductivity of the material.
Adding energy in the form of heat and light improves the conductivity of a semiconductor.

Practice Quiz 4-2-1
Answers:

Diodes are used in voltage regulators and limiters.
In the ideal diode model, the forward bias region is characterized by Vd=0 and Id>0.
In the ideal diode plus voltage source model, the forward bias region is characterized by V_D = V_f and Id>0.
Different diode models are used to replace the real diode with a simpler version that approximates the i-v characteristics of the real diode.
