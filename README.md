Practice quiz 4-1-1
Answers:

Diodes are made by connecting a p-doped material to an n-doped material, creating a depletion region that causes a barrier to the flow of electricity when the diode is reverse biased.
In the forward bias region, the diode current i_D is positive.
In the non-conducting (or OFF) state of an ideal diode, the diode voltage, V_D is negative.

Practice Quiz 4-1-2
Answers:

Semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors, and operational amplifiers are non-linear devices
Doping a semiconductor material with impurities to add extra holes or electrons improves the conductivity of the material.
Adding energy in the form of heat and light improves the conductivity of a semiconductor.

Practice Quiz 4-2-1
Answers:

Diodes are used in voltage regulators and limiters.
In the ideal diode model, the forward bias region is characterized by Vd=0 and Id>0.
In the ideal diode plus voltage source model, the forward bias region is characterized by V_D = V_f and Id>0.
Different diode models are used to replace the real diode with a simpler version that approximates the i-v characteristics of the real diode.

Practice Quiz 4-5-1
Answers:
If V1 is A ramp,V1=t volts where t corresponds to time and V2 =0, then the diode first turns on at t=0.7 sec.
If V_1 = 2V and V2=2v then the diode is Off.
If v1 =4v and V2=2v , then the diode is on.

  ** 1st Question**
  1.In an ideal full wave bridge rectifier, half of the diodes are in the ON state and half of the diodes are in the OFF state at any given time the input voltage is not zero.
  2.The output of an ideal full wave rectifier is zero volts only when the input is zero volts.
  3.A turn-on voltage of a diode (V_f) greater than zero can cause the output of a full wave rectifier to be zero volts even when the input is not zero volts.
